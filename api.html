                A set of rules for communicating with the server.
                The URL to connect with the server must be properly formed.

                1. Client: Makes a request according to the REST API rules (menu).
                2. REST API: Sends the request in a way the server understands.
                3. Server: Processes the request.
                4. REST API: Delivers the response (stringified object).
